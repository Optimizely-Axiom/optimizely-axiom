# ModalLayer

`ModalLayer` is a helper component intended to wrap components that are rendered inside portals inside other dialogs or popovers.

## Documentation

### Usage

Dialog and popover components internally use focus managers to ensure focus trapping works consistently across browsers. This works for all elements inside the DOM tree of the dialog/popover, but elements rendered via portals are not automatically tracked.

All of our components automatically handle this focus management when being rendered inside dialogs/popovers - but third party portalled components need to be manually wrapped in the `ModalLayer` component.
