`Box` is the base component for all UI components and provides a convenient way to use our design tokens and set element styles without having to write any custom CSS.

## Basic usage

### Using design tokens

<ax-demo name="box/usage" />

### Composition

`Box` component uses the [`@radix-ui` Composition](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/guides/composition) approach and accepts an `asChild` prop. By default it renders a `div` element but when `asChild` is set to `true` it will instead render its child element.

<ax-demo name="box/composition-usage" />

### `BoxProps`

We export a `BoxProps` generic type that can be used to define prop types for components that extend `Box`.

The **first argument** is the element or component type which defaults to `div`.

The **second argument** is any additional custom prop types that component accepts.
