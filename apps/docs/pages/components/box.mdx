`Box` is the base component for all UI components and provides a convenient way to use our design tokens and set element styles without having to write any custom CSS.

## Basic usage

### Composition

`Box` component uses the [`@radix-ui` Composition](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/guides/composition) approach and accepts an `asChild` prop. By default it renders a `div` element but when `asChild` is set to `true` it will instead render its child element.
