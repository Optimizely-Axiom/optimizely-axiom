`Button` component is used to trigger actions.

## Basic usage

### Usage

<ax-demo name="button/usage" />

### Appearance

Use the `appearance` prop to select between the different button appearances. You can also alternatively use the `colorScheme` and `variant` props to fine tune the appearance of the button.

<ax-demo name="button/appearance-usage" />

### Different sizes

Use the `size` prop to modify the size of the button.

<ax-demo name="button/size-usage" />

### Disabled state

Set the `disabled` prop to `true` to disable buttons and prevent any interactions.

For accessibility please make sure to include text that explains why the button is disabled or use a tooltip.

<ax-demo name="button/disabled-usage" />

## Icons

### Left and right icons

Use the `icon` prop to add icons to a button. Icons are placed to the left by default but that can be configured using the `iconPosition` prop.

<ax-demo name="button/icon-usage" />

### Icon button

Use the `icon` prop and omit the `children` to display an icon only button.

For accessibility please make sure to include an `aria-label` prop for screen readers and/or use tooltip to clearly denote the button's intent.

<ax-demo name="button/icon-only-usage" />

## Groups

### Grouping buttons

Use the `<ButtonGroup />` component to group related buttons together.

<ax-demo name="button/group-usage" />

## Links

### Button as links

Set `asChild` to `true` and pass an `<a>` element as the child to render buttons as links.

<ax-demo name="button/link-usage" />

### Disabled button links

Make sure to prevent interactions manually using `event.preventDefault()` since `<a>` elements do not support the `disabled` prop.

Alternatively you can use our `Link` component which supports the `disabled` prop.

<ax-demo name="button/link-disabled-usage" />
