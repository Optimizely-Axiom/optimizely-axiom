`Text` component is used to display body or any other form of text. The default root element is `p` which can be configured using the `asChild` prop.

<ax-demo name="text/usage" />

## Composition

`Text` component uses the [`@radix-ui` Composition](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/guides/composition) approach and accepts an `asChild` prop. By default it renders a `p` element but when `asChild` is set to `true` it will instead pass all props to its child element.

<ax-demo name="text/composition-usage" />

## `as` prop

`Text` component supports the `as` prop to conveniently switch the element type. This prop is purely semantic and does not alter visual appearance.

<ax-demo name="text/as-usage" />

## Formatting

<ax-demo name="text/formatting-usage" />

## Truncate

Use the `truncate` prop to truncate the text and add an ellipsis at the end.

<ax-demo name="text/truncate-usage" />
