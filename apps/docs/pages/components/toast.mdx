import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<ax-layout />

Display a brief notification.

## Basic usage

### Usage

The `<ToastProvider />` element displays toasts and must be included in a single place in your react application tree.

Toasts are then managed using a `toaster` instance returned from the `createToaster()` method. Use `toaster.create()` along with `<Toast />` to add a toast.

<ax-demo name="toast/usage" />

### Appearance

Use the `colorScheme` prop to select between the different toast types.

<ax-demo name="toast/appearance-usage" />

### Position

Use the `position` prop on `ToastProvider` to control where in the screen toasts are placed.

<ax-demo name="toast/position-usage" />

### Action

Use the `ToastAction` component to include a short action button associated with the toast.
