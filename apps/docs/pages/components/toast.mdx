## Documentation

### Usage

`ToastProvider` component provides the context manager for toasts and is also responsible for displays them. It must be rendered at the root of your application and should be used only once.

Toasts are managed using a `toaster` instance returned from the `createToaster()` method. Use `toaster.create()` along with the `Toast` component to add toasts.

<ax-demo name="toast/usage" />

### Appearance

Use the `colorScheme` prop to select between the different toast types.

<ax-demo name="toast/appearance-usage" />

### Position

Use the `position` prop on `ToastProvider` to control where in the screen toasts are placed.

<ax-demo name="toast/position-usage" />

### Action

Use the `ToastAction` component to include a short action button associated with the toast.

<ax-demo name="toast/action-usage" />
