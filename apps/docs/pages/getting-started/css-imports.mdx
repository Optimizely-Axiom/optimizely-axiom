# CSS Imports

All Axiom components import their own CSS files via `import` statements from within the JS code.

Depending on your bundler you might require additional configuration to enable CSS imports.

<Callout type="info">
  Check out the guide on [CSS Layers](/getting-started/css-layers) if your
  existing styles are conflicting with Axiom.

## Webpack

### CSS loader

Use [`css-loader`](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/css-loader/) to include the CSS in your bundled code.
