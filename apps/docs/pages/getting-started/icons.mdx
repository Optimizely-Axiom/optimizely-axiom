# Icons (Optimizely staff only)

We use a licensed **Font Awesome** icon kit with our Optimizely Design System.

<Alert intent="warning" mt="16">
  <AlertTitle>Font Awesome Pro License</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    The icon kit is not publicly available and only published through our
    private package repository. For demonstration purposes our docs uses another
    publicly available icon library - but for our products we should always use
    icons from our **Font Awesome** icon kit.
