# Style Props

The `Box` component supports a minimal zero-runtime styled system built with [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/) similar to **Tailwind CSS**.

Developers are free to choose any styling solution for components but out of the box support is provided for majority styling solutions via style props.

## Basic usage

You can directly use props to control styles:

<ax-demo name="styles-prop-usage" />

### `sx` Prop

As an alternative to individual style props you can also use the `sx` prop to control styles:

<ax-demo name="styles-sx/usage" />

The `sx` prop will take precedence over native props and should not be used together to control the same properties.

<Callout type="warning">
  Do not mix native props and `sx` props to control the same styles.
</Callout>

<ax-demo name="styles-sx/order-usage" />

Instead always prefer native props and only use `sx` if have to use `hover` or other modifiers.

## Applying conditionally

### Hover, focus, and other states

Use the `sx` prop to conditionally apply styles for different states like `hover`, `focus` etc.

<Callout>Hover over the button to see the background color change:</Callout>

<ax-demo name="styles-sx/hover-usage" />

Check out the documentation on [State Modifiers](/styled-system/state-modifiers/).

### Breakpoints and media queries

You can also use object or array prop notation to apply styles at various responsive breakpoints.

<Callout>Resize the canvas to see the button color change:</Callout>

<ax-demo
  iframe="/styled-system/index-demo/"
  height="150"
  name="styles-sx/responsive-usage"
/>
