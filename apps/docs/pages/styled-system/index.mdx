# Style Props

The `Box` component supports a minimal zero-runtime styled system built with [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/) similar to **Tailwind CSS**.

Developers are free to choose any styling solution for components but out of the box support is provided for majority styling solutions via style props.

## Usage

You can directly use props to control styles:

<ax-demo name="styles-prop-usage" />

### `sx` Prop

As an alternative to individual style props you can also use the `sx` prop to control styles and additionally configure `hover` and other modifiers:

<ax-demo name="styles-sx-usage" />

The `sx` prop will take precedence over native props and should not be used together to control the same properties.

<Callout type="warning">
  Do not mix native props and `sx` props to control the same styles.
</Callout>

<ax-demo name="styles-sx-order-usage" />

Instead always prefer native props and only use `sx` if have to use `hover` or other modifiers.
