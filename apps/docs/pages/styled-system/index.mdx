# Style Props

The `Box` component supports a minimal zero-runtime styled system built with [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/) similar to **Tailwind CSS**.

Developers are free to choose any styling solution for components but out of the box support is provided for majority styling solutions via style props.

## Usage

You can directly use props to control styles:
