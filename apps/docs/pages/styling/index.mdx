# Style Props

The [Box](/components/) component provides a minimal zero-runtime styling solution built with [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/).

We provide out of the box support for consuming our design tokens and commonly used styles via props, but developers are free to choose any styling solution for components.

## Documentation

### Utility based styling

You can use props on the `<Box />` component to control styles:

<Demo component={PropUsage} />

Learn more about consuming [Design Tokens](/styling/design-tokens/).

### Breakpoints and media queries

You can also use object or array prop notation to apply styles at various responsive breakpoints.

<Alert intent="warning" mt="16">
  <AlertDescription>
    Resize the canvas to see the layout change:
  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>

<Demo iframe="/styling/index-demo/" height="150" component={ResponsiveUsage} />

Check out the documentation on [Responsive Styles](/styling/responsive-styles/).
